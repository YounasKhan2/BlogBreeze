# 🔧 Fix Deployment Error - "No module named 'app'"

## The Problem

Your deployment failed with this error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'
```

This means Render is using the **wrong Start Command**.

---

## The Solution

You need to update the **Start Command** in your Render web service settings.

### Current (Wrong) Command:
```
gunicorn app:app
```

### Correct Command:
```
gunicorn BlogBreeze.wsgi:application
```

---

## How to Fix It

### Step 1: Go to Your Web Service Settings

1. Log in to Render.com
2. Click on your web service (blogbreeze)
3. Click **"Settings"** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Find Start Command

1. Scroll down to **"Build & Deploy"** section
2. Find **"Start Command"** field

### Step 3: Update the Command

1. **Delete** the current command: `gunicorn app:app`
2. **Enter** the correct command:
   ```
   gunicorn BlogBreeze.wsgi:application
   ```
3. Click **"Save Changes"**

### Step 4: Redeploy

1. Scroll to the top
2. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button
3. Select **"Deploy latest commit"**
4. Click **"Deploy"**

## Visual Guide

```
Render Dashboard
    ↓
Your Web Service (blogbreeze)
    ↓
Settings (left sidebar)
    ↓
Scroll to "Build & Deploy"
    ↓
Find "Start Command"
    ↓
Change to: gunicorn BlogBreeze.wsgi:application
    ↓
Save Changes
    ↓
Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit
```

---

## Alternative: Update Build Command Too

While you're in settings, also verify the **Build Command**:

### Correct Build Command:
```
./build.sh
```

If it's different, update it to `./build.sh`

---

## After Fixing

Once you save and redeploy:

1. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for deployment
2. **Check the logs** - you should see:
   ```
   [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:10000
   [INFO] Using worker: sync
   ```
3. **Visit your app URL** - it should work!

---

## Why This Happened

When you created the web service, you might have:
- Left the Start Command field empty (Render guessed wrong)
- Typed the wrong command manually
- Used a template for a different framework

The correct command for Django is always:
```
gunicorn YourProjectName.wsgi:application
```

In your case: `BlogBreeze.wsgi:application`

---

## Verification Checklist

After fixing, verify these settings:

### Build & Deploy Section:
- [ ] **Build Command**: `./build.sh`
- [ ] **Start Command**: `gunicorn BlogBreeze.wsgi:application`

### Environment Variables:
- [ ] `PYTHON_VERSION` = `3.11.0`
- [ ] `SECRET_KEY` = (generated)
- [ ] `DEBUG` = `False`
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` = `postgresql://...`

---

## If It Still Fails

### Check the Logs

Look for these specific errors:

**Error 1: "build.sh: Permission denied"**
- The build.sh file needs to be executable
- We'll fix this below

**Error 2: "No such file or directory: build.sh"**
- The build.sh file is missing
- Make sure it's in your GitHub repo

**Error 3: Database connection error**
- Check DATABASE_URL is set correctly
- Use Internal Database URL (not External)

---

## Fix build.sh Permission (If Needed)

If you get "Permission denied" for build.sh:

### Option 1: Make it executable locally
```bash
# On your local machine
git update-index --chmod=+x build.sh
git commit -m "Make build.sh executable"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Update Build Command
Change Build Command to:
```
chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
```

---
